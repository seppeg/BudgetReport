# Story 0008: Continuous Deployment

The budget monitor should be able to be deployed to an OpenShift cluster. For initial testing and developing it can be locally deployed to a minishift cluster.

Creating the cluster and deploying to it should be done with infrastructure as code.

A pipeline to deploy RELEASE artifacts should also be created.
